# Intelligent Street Lighting System with Solar Power, Human Presence Detection, Air Purification, and Emergency Response

## Abstract
This project presents an innovative street lighting system that integrates solar power, human presence detection, air purification, and emergency response. The system utilizes a solar panel to harness energy during the day, which is then stored in a battery for nighttime use. When the sun sets, the streetlight enters a dim mode, conserving energy until a vehicle, cyclist, or pedestrian is detected by ultrasonic and human presence sensors. The system is designed to ignore animals, minimizing false triggers.

In addition to energy-efficient lighting, the system features an air purification module that removes particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone from the air, improving the surrounding air quality. This module utilizes a high-efficiency air filter and a UV-based purification system, ensuring a significant reduction in air pollutants.

## Air Purification Method
The air purification method employed in this system uses electronic air cleaners, which utilize electrostatic charges to attract and trap airborne pollutants. This method is effective in removing particulate matter, bacteria, and viruses from the air, improving indoor and outdoor air quality.

## Relevance
Air purification is highly relevant in today's society, as air pollution has become a major concern globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths worldwide each year. Furthermore, the increasing urbanization and industrialization have led to a significant rise in air pollutants, making air purification a necessity.

## Emergency Response Feature
The system also incorporates an emergency response feature, utilizing sound frequency detection to identify potential accidents. The system is calibrated to detect sound frequencies between 100-140 dB, corresponding to the intensity of sounds emitted during accidents, such as:

- Car crashes (120-130 dB)
- Sirens (100-120 dB)
- Breaking glass (110-120 dB)

### Amplitude Variation Analysis
To improve the accuracy of accident detection, the system employs amplitude variation analysis. Accident sounds, such as breaking glass or crushing metal, exhibit high amplitude values, rapid amplitude increases, and short durations. By analyzing these characteristics, the system can differentiate between accidents and other loud noises, such as car horns.

### Comparison of Horn and Accident Frequencies
The system takes into account the differences in frequency and amplitude between car horns and accidents. Car horns typically produce sound frequencies between 100-800 Hz, with amplitudes ranging from 90-115 dB. In contrast, accidents produce sound frequencies with higher amplitudes (120-140 dB) and shorter durations. By leveraging these differences, the system can reduce false alarms and improve its accuracy in detecting accidents.
